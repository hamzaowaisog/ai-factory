> # Co-working Space — Maintenance Requests
> 
> ## 1. Product Overview
> 
> A small web app for **Hive Works**, a single co-working space. People who work there report things that need fixing (a broken chair, a leaking tap, a dead light), and the front-desk manager moves each request from open to done.
> 
> This release is deliberately small: **2 screens**, one user, one kind of record. Sections 4 to 7 are the whole scope; nothing beyond them is wanted.
> 
> There is no existing application code. It is a web front end with a small API and a database behind it.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 2. Product Goals
> 
> - Report a problem in under a minute.
> - See at a glance what is open, in progress and done.
> - Keep the status of a request honest: it can only move in the allowed order.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 3. User
> 
> One already-signed-in demo user, **Sam Carter** (initials "SC"), who can do everything in this document. There is no sign-in screen and there are no roles.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 4. Data
> 
> ### 4.1 Request
> 
> | Field | Rules |
> | --- | --- |
> | ID | Set by the system |
> | Title | Required, 3 to 80 characters |
> | Area | Required, one of `Kitchen`, `Meeting room`, `Open desk`, `Washroom`, `Reception` |
> | Priority | Required, one of `Low`, `Normal`, `Urgent` |
> | Description | Optional, up to 500 characters |
> | Status | One of `Open`, `In progress`, `Done` |
> | Created | Set by the system when the request is made |
> 
> There is no other record type.
> 
> ### 4.2 Seed Data
> 
> The app ships with exactly 8 requests:
> 
> - 4 `Open` (one of them `Urgent`)
> - 2 `In progress`
> - 2 `Done`
> 
> Between them they use every area at least once.
> 
> ### 4.3 Persistence
> 
> Requests are stored in the database and survive a reload and a restart.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 5. Business Rules
> 
> 1. **Valid request** — A request needs a title of 3 to 80 characters, an area and a priority. A description, when given, is at most 500 characters. Anything else is rejected with a message naming the field.
> 2. **Starts open** — A new request always starts as `Open`.
> 3. **Status order** — The only allowed status changes are:
>    - `Open` → `In progress`
>    - `In progress` → `Done`
>    - `Done` → `Open` (reopen)
> 
>    Any other change is rejected.
> 4. **Fixed after creation** — Title, area, priority and description cannot be changed after the request is made. Requests cannot be deleted.
> 
> The rules are enforced by the API, not only by the screens.
> 
> ### 5.1 API operations
> 
> The API needs these four operations and no others:
> 
> 1. List requests, optionally only those with one given status. Newest first.
> 2. Create a request.
> 3. Get one request by ID.
> 4. Change the status of one request.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 6. Screens
> 
> ### Screen 1 — Requests (home)
> 
> - Top bar: "Hive Works" wordmark and the user's initials.
> - Status filter with four choices: `All`, `Open`, `In progress`, `Done`. One is selected at a time; `All` is the default.
> - **New request** button.
> - List of requests, newest first. Each row shows: title, area, priority badge, status badge and created date (for example "8 Oct 2026").
> - Clicking a row opens Screen 2.
> 
> **New request dialog**
> 
> - Opened by the New request button.
> - Fields: Title, Area (select), Priority (select, default `Normal`), Description (multi-line).
> - Buttons: `Create` and `Cancel`.
> - A field that breaks rule 1 shows its message under the field, and the dialog stays open.
> - On success the dialog closes and the new request is at the top of the list.
> 
> **States**
> 
> - Loading: "Loading requests…"
> - Empty (no requests for the selected filter): "No requests here."
> - Error: "Could not load requests." with a `Retry` button.
> 
> ### Screen 2 — Request detail
> 
> - Back link to Screen 1.
> - Title, area, priority badge, status badge, created date and description (or "No description." when there is none).
> - One action button, depending on status:
> 
> | Status | Button |
> | --- | --- |
> | `Open` | `Start work` (moves to `In progress`) |
> | `In progress` | `Mark done` (moves to `Done`) |
> | `Done` | `Reopen` (moves to `Open`) |
> 
> - After the change, the status badge and the button show the new status.
> - If the change fails: "Could not update the request." The status shown stays as it was.
> - An ID that does not exist shows "Request not found." with a link back to Screen 1.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 7. Design Requirements
> 
> Clean and plain; a tidy internal tool.
> 
> - One light theme. No dark mode.
> - One brand colour for primary buttons, a neutral background, near-black text.
> - Status badges: `Open` blue, `In progress` amber, `Done` green. Priority `Urgent` red; `Low` and `Normal` neutral. Every badge shows its text, so colour is never the only signal.
> - One sans-serif font.
> - Works at 375 px wide (rows stack as cards) and at 1280 px wide (rows as a table). No horizontal page scroll.
> - Every field has a label, every control can be reached by keyboard, and text meets WCAG AA contrast.
> - No animation is required.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 8. Decisions Already Made
> 
> These are settled and need no question:
> 
> - No sign-in, no roles, no second user.
> - No editing or deleting a request.
> - No search, no sorting choices, no paging. The list shows every request for the selected filter.
> - No comments, attachments, assignees or due dates.
> - No notifications, email or live updates. The list is current when the page loads or the filter changes.
> - No optimistic updates and no undo: the screen changes after the API answers.
> - The created date is stored in UTC and shown as a date only, with no time and no timezone handling.
> - English only.
> - A double click on `Create` must not make two requests: the button is disabled while the request is being sent.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 9. Testing Requirements
> 
> Automated tests for the business rules:
> 
> - A valid request is created and starts as `Open`.
> - A request with a missing or too-short title, a missing area or a too-long description is rejected.
> - Each of the three allowed status changes works.
> - A status change outside the allowed order is rejected.
> - The list filtered by a status returns only requests with that status, newest first.
> - An unknown ID is answered as not found.
> 
> Plus one end-to-end test: open the list → create a request → see it at the top → open it → Start work → Mark done → filter by `Done` and see it there.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 10. Acceptance Criteria Examples
> 
> **Create**
> 
> Given the New request dialog is open,
> When the user enters the title "Kitchen tap is leaking", area `Kitchen`, priority `Urgent` and clicks `Create`,
> Then the dialog closes and the request is first in the list with status `Open`.
> 
> **Validation**
> 
> Given the New request dialog is open,
> When the user clicks `Create` with a title of 2 characters,
> Then the dialog stays open and the Title field shows "Title must be 3 to 80 characters."
> 
> **Status order**
> 
> Given a request with status `Open`,
> When a change straight to `Done` is sent to the API,
> Then it is rejected and the status stays `Open`.
> 
> **Filter**
> 
> Given the seed data,
> When the user selects the `In progress` filter,
> Then exactly 2 requests are listed.
> 
> **Not found**
> 
> Given no request has the ID in the address,
> When Screen 2 opens,
> Then it shows "Request not found."
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 11. Final Scope Summary
> 
> Two screens over one record type:
> 
> 1. **Requests** — a filtered list and a dialog to create a request.
> 2. **Request detail** — the request and one button that moves its status forward or reopens it.
> 
> Four API operations, four business rules, 8 seeded requests, one light theme.
> 
> This run builds the API side of the product above, in an existing .NET API project. Build every operation of the locked API contract in contracts/openapi.yaml, exactly as it is written there. Keep the data in the project's PostgreSQL database (the connection string named App, which the project already reads), and write its sample data in App.Api/SeedData.cs: a few believable rows for each table, taken from the contract's examples, so each list has something to show. The app runs that file only when the setting Seed:Demo is true, so no test may count on those rows. The web app is built in its own repo; do not build screens here.

**Q-1** How many demo requests and what status/area coverage should SeedData.Run provide, given the product document specifies exactly eight but the implementation request asks for only a few contract-example rows?
  A. Seed exactly eight requests: four Open (including one Urgent), two In progress, and two Done, covering every area.
  B. Seed a few believable rows from the contract examples, without requiring eight rows or specified status and area counts.   ← recommended: This follows the specific implementation instruction without adding the product document’s unrequested seed-count and coverage requirements.
  (why it matters: The choice changes which records are written and what seeded list results users see.)

**Q-2** What should happen if SeedData.Run is invoked more than once while demo seeding is enabled?
  A. Do not insert duplicate demo rows on repeated runs.   ← recommended: Preventing repeated seed inserts keeps demo data from accumulating while preserving non-demo records.
  B. Insert the sample rows on every invocation, including repeated runs.
  C. Replace the existing demo rows with the sample set on each invocation.
  (why it matters: Repeated runs can write duplicate records or replace existing records in the database.)

**Q-3** For create-request validation, should the API implement only the validation and error details defined by the locked OpenAPI contract, or also enforce the product document’s explicit field limits and messages wherever they differ or are absent from the contract?
  A. Use only the validation and errors defined by the locked OpenAPI contract.   ← recommended: The request explicitly makes the locked contract authoritative and asks for its operations exactly as written.
  B. Also enforce the product document’s title length, required area and priority, description limit, and field-specific validation messages.
  C. Enforce the product document’s exact validation rules and messages even if they differ from the locked contract.
  (why it matters: Validation differences change what users see when submitting invalid data.)

**Q-4** If PostgreSQL is unreachable, should the application fail during startup, or start successfully and fail only when an operation needs the database?
  A. Fail startup when PostgreSQL cannot be reached; do not fall back to another store.   ← recommended: The existing startup path initializes the database, so failing startup preserves the current failure point and avoids introducing another store.
  B. Allow startup, then return an error from database-dependent operations while PostgreSQL is unavailable.
  C. Use another store temporarily when PostgreSQL cannot be reached.
  (why it matters: This determines whether the API is available during a database outage and changes the visible failure flow.)
